# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations for City Hotels and Resort Hotels.
High cancellation rates reduce revenue and leave rooms unused.
The goal of this analysis is to understand why cancellations happen and provide data-driven business recommendations to reduce them.


# 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand the key factors behind booking cancellations
- Compare cancellation patterns between City Hotels and Resort Hotels
- Analyze pricing, seasonality, and booking channels
- Provide practical business recommendations to reduce cancellations

# 📁 Project Structure

* 📊 CSV file – Raw hotel booking dataset
* 📓 Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations
* 📝 Report (DOCX) – Business problem, findings, and recommendations
* 🧠 Business Problem
    Both City Hotels and Resort Hotels have been facing high cancellation rates, leading to:
        - Loss of revenue
        - Poor room utilization
        - Difficulty in pricing and planning
        - Reducing cancellations is critical to improving overall hotel performance and profitability.

# 🔍 Assumptions

* The data from 2015–2017 is reliable and free from unusual disruptions
* Hotels are not already using the recommended strategies
* Booking cancellations have a major impact on revenue
* Canceled bookings result in empty rooms for the reserved period


# ❓ Research Questions

* What factors influence hotel booking cancellations?
* How can hotels reduce cancellation rates?
* How can this analysis help with pricing and promotions?


# 📌 Hypotheses

- Higher room prices lead to more cancellations
- Longer waiting periods increase the chance of cancellation
- Most bookings come from travel agents rather than direct customers

# 📊 Key Findings

- Around 37% of bookings are canceled, significantly affecting revenue
- City Hotels receive more bookings than Resort Hotels
- Resort Hotels often have higher average daily rates, especially on weekends
- August has the highest number of bookings and cancellations 
- January has the highest cancellation rate
- Cancellations increase as room prices increase
- Portugal shows the highest number of canceled bookings
- Most customers book through online travel agencies, while direct bookings are very low

# 💡 Business Recommendations

- Adjust pricing strategies to reduce cancellations during high-price periods
- Offer discounts for Resort Hotels, especially on weekends and holidays
- Launch marketing campaigns in January to reduce seasonal cancellations
- Improve service quality in high-cancellation regions such as Portugal
- Encourage direct bookings by offering exclusive benefits

# 🧾 Conclusion

The analysis shows that pricing, seasonality, location, and booking channels play a major role in hotel booking cancellations.
By improving pricing strategies and focusing on high-risk periods and locations, hotels can significantly reduce cancellations and increase revenue.
